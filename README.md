This is a group project developed for the course Advanced Game Design & Development at the University of Reykjavik. This is a 2D platformer game. Focused on boss battles. I developed and implemented the state machines for the AI and the player mechanics. I implemented the AI of the bosses with state machines and a probability script for deciding the next moves of the bosses.
I developed the ground boss, wind boss, water boss and the player mechanics. I also implemented a flexible state machine for handling the states of the animations.
